# Explanation of the code

The formula (x+k) mod 26 for the Caesar cipher is applied for Encryption 
and (x-k) mod 26 is applied for Decryption.

According to my code:

- `x`: Represents the ASCII value of the character to be encrypted.
- `k`: The shift value, or the number of positions to shift the character.
- `mod  26`: The modulo operation ensures that the result wraps around the alphabet. Since there are  26 letters in the English alphabet, the result must be within the range  0 to  25.

The line of code:

```python
shifted_char = chr(((ord(char) - ascii_offset + shift) %   26) + ascii_offset)
```

performs the Caesar cipher operation for a single character `char`.

1. `ord(char)`: This gets the ASCII value of the character.
2. `ascii_offset`: This is the ASCII value of either 'a' or 'A', depending on whether the character is lowercase or uppercase. It's used to align the ASCII values of the characters with the range  0 to  25.
3. `ord(char) - ascii_offset`: By subtracting the ASCII offset, the ASCII value of the character is aligned with the range  0 to  25, where 'a' or 'A' is  0, 'b' or 'B' is  1, and so on up to 'z' or 'Z' being  25.
4. `ord(char) - ascii_offset + shift`: The shift value is added to the aligned ASCII value.
5. `((ord(char) - ascii_offset + shift) %   26)`: The modulo operation ensures that the sum wraps around the range  0 to  25.
6. `((ord(char) - ascii_offset + shift) %   26) + ascii_offset`: The ASCII offset is added back to convert the result back into an ASCII value within the range of alphabetic characters.
7. `chr(...)`: The `chr()` function converts the resulting ASCII value back into a character.

So, the formula `(x+k) mod  26` is reflected in this line of code, where `x` is the ASCII value of the character minus the offset, `k` is the shift value, and the result is taken modulo  26 to ensure it remains within the range of the alphabet.

In Decryption: `result = caesar_cipher(text,   26 - shift_value)`
`26 - shift_value`: This calculation reverses the encryption process. If you were to encrypt a text with a shift value of k, to decrypt it, you would shift the text back by 26 - k positions. This is because the Caesar cipher is a cyclic cipher, meaning that after the last letter of the alphabet, the next letter is the first letter of the alphabet. So, to undo the shift, you go in the opposite direction by the same amount but in the opposite cycle 4.
